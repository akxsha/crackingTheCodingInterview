# Cracking the Coding Interview 

### Sliding Window Pattern

* Good for **subset** and **subarray** problems
* Easy way to take a O(n^2) into a O(n) complexity 
* Resources:
  * Videos:

---
* Notes:
  * create the "window" with p1 and p2
{% raw %}
```
int p1 = 0;
int p2 = n; // with n as the length of window

/* ex:
n = 3
[4, 5, 7, 9, 20, 4, 9, 3, 11, 4, 3]
p1____p2
    p1____p2
       p1____p2
*/
```
{% endraw %}

#### *Other Array Patterns*
[Link] https://www.rose-hulman.edu/class/cs/csse120/Resources/C/Arrays/arrayPatterns.pdf

1. Accessesing the kth element
2. Printing Values (for loop)
3. Printing Values backwards (for loop)
4. Counting the number of elements in the array that meet a given condition. (for loop with nested if {condition} )
5. Summing the elements in an array (for loop)
